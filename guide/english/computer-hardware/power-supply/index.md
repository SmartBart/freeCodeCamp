## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. 

Other than by its size (factor), PSUs differ mainly by the power they provide to the Computer System. Usually a 350 W (watt) Power Supply will be enough for most computers (desktops). If a robust Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or many Hard Drives (HDDs) are used - more powerful PSU wll be required. If undergraded PSU is connected - the computer will not start or may be unstable.

As Power Supplies are quite heavy, laptops normally use external PSUs connected by a wire.

Some computers (e.i. servers) may contain two or more redundant Power Supplies. 

A PSU is usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit.
